# pneumoinfer

This is a class structure and notebook implementation for inferring and simulating a type of multi-state models with a counting memory which records previous state occupations. The inference is currently written for pneumococcus-like models but may be generalised to others in the future.

The nifty thing that `pneumoinfer` does is it implements an approximate ODE description of the system (which would otherwise have to be explicitly simulated) and hence there is a radical reduction in time required to compute the likelihood of the model with respect to a given data set in comparison to other methods. The details behind this mathematical trickery are given in the technical article posted here: [umbralcalc.github.io/posts/pneumoinfer.html](https://umbralcalc.github.io/posts/pneumoinfer.html).
