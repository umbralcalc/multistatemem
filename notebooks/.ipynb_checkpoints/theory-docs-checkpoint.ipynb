    "## Motivating background\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-state models - stochastic processes occupying one of a finite set of states at each moment in time - appear to describe many natural phenomena, but are probably most frequently used in the mathematical modelling of population health. The statistical inference (or selection) of these models for real-world applications frequently involves data in the form of a sequence of individual state observations, which are often coupled with some diagnostic uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are over 90 known capsular serotypes of _Streptococcus pneumoniae_, which persist despite their mutual competition for the same ecological niche (the nasopharynx) and a known fitness gradient. Motivated by the global pneumococcal disease burden, a specific class of multi-state models has been developed to describe the carriage dynamics which offers a neat explanation of this persistence through immunity-driven stabilisation effects (see [Cobey & Lipsitch (2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22383809/)). This class of model typically uses a counting memory of past state (or serotype) occupations (or colonisations) as a model for human immunity (see, e.g., [Flasche et al. (2013)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2013.1939) for an alternative formulation and [Lochen & Anderson (2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31055164/) for a general review of the carriage transmission models). Building from these mathematical models, a range of statistical approaches have also been used to infer the pneumococcal carriage through a given population from nasopharyngeal swab sample data (e.g., [Lipsitch et al. (2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22441543/) and [Numminen et al. (2013)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23822205/)). All of this is obviously really important, e.g., to understanding more precisely how a vaccine covering a restricted range of serotypes can impact colonisation in a given community or region. \n",
    "\n",
    "The design of policies for gathering data will always have a direct impact on the quality and utility of information that can be learned about a model via statistical inference. Therefore, it's typically useful to know _a priori_ the fundamental constraints a given policy might impose on this procedure. The purpose of the `pneumoinfer` class is to provide researchers with a rigorous framework to investigate these limitations for the inference of multi-state models with a counting memory - which are structurally inspired by the pneumococcus carriage models of [Cobey & Lipsitch (2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22383809/) and [Lipsitch et al. (2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22441543/). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this documentation, we're going to: analyse the master equation of a stochastic model which includes memory effects from individual immunity; investigate a novel (to our knowledge) approximate ODE description for the dynamics, while assessing its validity; and utilise a Fisher approximation to study the effect of varying the total time period of sampling, the sample size and the number of states to establish fundamental bounds on inferring parameters of the model. By then exploiting the new efficient ODE description, we will be able to develop a new method of inference that avoids biasing from overly large sampling windows; which is the main inference method implemented in the `pneumoinfer` class."

    "## Fixed $\\Lambda_i$ model\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now construct a multi-state model which incorporates a counting memory of past state occupations. This will include: an event rate of state clearance $\\tilde{\\mu}_i$ - the rate at which an individual occupying the $i$-th indexed state returns to the null state; an event rate of susceptibility $\\tilde{\\Lambda}_i$ for an individual moving to the $i$-th state from the null state; and a state-specific factor matrix $f_{ii'}$ which rescales $\\tilde{\\Lambda}_{i'}$ to create an event rate for an individual moving directly between the $i$-th and $i'$-th states. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider $\\tilde{\\mu}_i=\\tilde{\\mu}_i( \\dots, n_{i}, \\dots )$, i.e., a function of all previous state occupations by the individual, where $n_i$ are the state-specific counts of past occupations. The rate $\\tilde{\\mu}_i$ hence maintains a 'record' of past state occupations and updates accordingly through this memory. Additionally, we will make each rate $\\tilde{\\Lambda}_i=\\tilde{\\Lambda}_i(n_{i})$, i.e., a function _only_ of the state-specific count associated to each rate, respectively. The choice in the latter case comes from interpreting the counting memory as a model for capsular immunity - this will also turn out to be quite important for our approximation further on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in [Cobey & Lipsitch (2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22383809/), the models of nonspecific and specific immunity suggest choosing the following functions\n",

    "The multi-state process that we're going to consider would be normally be described as a non-Markovian phenomenon. However, the modelling approach we will take is instead a bit more similar to the formal concept of a Markov embedding (as studied, e.g., recently in [Kanazawa & Sornette (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00242)).

    "Though we intend our analysis of this class of multi-state models to apply more generally beyond immediate applications to pneumococcus, it also is worth noting that restricting individuals to occupy a single state at a time only approximates the full pneumococcal carriage dynamics. The true process actually allows for some individuals to carry more than one serotype at at time. However, due to the relatively low and variable reported prevalence of simultaneous serotype carriers (or 'co-colonised' individuals) across different studies (see, e.g., [Gratten et al. (1989)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2639508/), [Huebner et al.
